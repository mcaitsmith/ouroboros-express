        urshu "Lounging about again, I see. Kicking the feet up and enjoying the ride, hmm?"


        susurha happy "You know it, Mr. Conductor. Envious?"


        urshu "Envious? Ah, do you spot a green-eyed monster, perhaps? I don’t have nearly enough time in the day for such feelings."


        susurha "Mhm."


        urshu "How do you do it?"


        susurha neutral "Do what?"


        urshu "Present yourself as so relaxed."


        susurha "Present?"


        susurha happy "Look at you. So confident that I’m playing pretend."


        susurha neutral "What about yourself? Coming here to criticize me. Acting like you’re better than I."


        urshu sad "..."


        urshu sad "I come to you, honestly."


        susurha neutral "Sure you do, dragging me here to this contraption really invokes such ideas."


        urshu sad "What are you afraid of? What makes you wear this mask of relaxation?"


        susurha angry "I wear no mask! So don’t even try to project your own lies onto me!"


        susurha angry "Your dashing physique and alluring voice may convince the others to play your little game, but I see you for the creature you are."


        urshu sad "I merely wish to help, Susu’Rha."


        urshu sad "Not everyone is scheming."


        vivithinking "I can feel the heat burn as Susu’Rha snarls."


        susurha sad "..."


        susurha sad "Just remove yourself from my sight."


        susurha sad "You know nothing of me."


        urshu sad "It is a great shame that no one does."
