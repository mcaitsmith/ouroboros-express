    darius angry "I know what it is like to toy with your prey. I don’t appreciate it.”

    urshu happy "My sincerest apologies. We want everyone’s experience aboard the Ouroboros Express to be as pleasant as possible.”

    darius angry "Stuff it down your stack.”

    urshu happy "Pardon?”

    darius neutral "All this. It’s a facade. And you’re acting like a damn clown. There is a gravity to all this.”

    darius angry "One that you are either entirely unaware of or cannot begin to understand.”

    urshu surprised "Explain it to me.”

    darius neutral "This train. These people. It’s all some game to you. I was responsible for the fates of thousands. Maybe millions.”

    darius angry "This is not what was meant for me. Maybe the others. Not me.”

    urshu neutral "Go on.”

    darius neutral "I wanted… more. There must be more. Something to give some kind of context.”

    darius surprised "This can’t be all there is. What about my service? All I’ve done? Does that not count for anything here?”

    darius angry "I need it to mean something.”

    urshu neutral "It does. In fact, I’d say everything is coming together better than I’d hoped.”

    urshu happy "Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Sanssouci?”

    vivithinking surprised "Crap on a cracker, they must have heard me. Sensed me? Who can say.”

    vivithinking sad "Ugh– my tummy just flipped. Like when I walked in on my editor and her secretary kissing.”

    vivithinking neutral "Only this time the embarrassment is from being caught by a walking squid and a little shit.”

    vivi surprised "Um…hello. I didn’t hear anything.”

    darius neutral "Miss. Good night.”

    vivithinking sad "A wave of something like sadness just crashed over me.”
    vivi surprised "What was that about?”

    urshu neutral "Dear Darius is simply adjusting. They will be fine. Do excuse me."
