    urshu sad "Alas, our goddess of the sun, Avatar of the Eternal Light, collapsed under the unbearable weight of her self-imposed hatred and inescapable emptiness." 
    urshu angry "Unable to connect, cut off from love, burning with pain as sharp as a scalpel, our lovely Avatar exploded into a supernova of fury and regret." 
    urshu sad "Soon after, her darkness reunited itself in the void as a ravenous Plutonian maw; a cosmic Eldritch whirlpool slaughtering all who crossed its path—just as she was slaughtered long ago."
