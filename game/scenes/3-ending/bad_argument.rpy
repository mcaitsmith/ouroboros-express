    # Bad Ending/Argument

    #Naj's Note: Feel free to use these lines I've written (or not)!


    # You're boring me. 

    # Seems terribly gauche. 

    # Meaning? There is no meaning. I looked for it everywhere, growing up you know. I chased it - hunted it down. In religious books, in my studies, in the disappointing adults that had little to say except the same tiresome phrases"

    # And then I grew up and looked for meaning in parties, in other people's beds. I looked for meaning in the warmth of others and found it to be a barren fucking wasteland."

    # And then I realized, it's me. I'm devoid of meaning. So if you're asking me what all this means - you're asking the wrong fucking person.

    # To Ava: You think you're something really special, when in reality you're nothing but ordinary. An average woman told they were great so much they began to believe the lies. 

    # To Darius: Spare me your guilt. Sentimentality! You might not have stained your gloves, Mr. Inquisitor, but you have blood on your hands. I hope you've reckoned with that.

    # To Susu'Rha: You reek of nepotistic privilege. You think you're the first royal in the world to run away from home? Please. And now you're filled with regret, why? It's YOUR FAULT. Don't try and bullshit a bullshitter,alright?
