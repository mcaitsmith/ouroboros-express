    # Bad Ending/Argument

    #Naj's Note: Feel free to use these lines I've written (or not)!


    # You're boring me. 

    # Seems terribly gauche. 

    # Meaning? There is no meaning. I looked for it everywhere, growing up you know. I chased it - hunted it down. In religious books, in my studies, in the disappointing adults that had little to say except the same tiresome phrases"

    # And then I grew up and looked for meaning in parties, in other people's beds. I looked for meaning in the warmth of others and found it to be a barren fucking wasteland."

    # And then I realized, it's me. I'm devoid of meaning. So if you're asking me what all this means - you're asking the wrong fucking person.

    # To Ava: You think you're something really special, when in reality you're nothing but cattle - raised to be slaughtered. 

    # To Darius: Spare me your guilt. Sentimentality! You might not have stained your gloves, Mr. Inquisitor, but you have blood on your hands. I hope you've reckoned with that.

    # To Susu'Rha: You reek of nepotistic privilege. You think you're the first royal in the world to run away from home? Please. And now you're filled with regret, why? Because your family DIED. And it's YOUR FAULT. Don't try and bullshit a bullshitter,alright?

Perhaps he always was. What he feared on the Express wasn't his master, but himself. His clean and perfectly groomed visage morphed and shifted, becoming the monstrous figure they so feared. Somewhere deep down he knew this was the fate fitting for him, a horror in body to reflect the monster within.
