    urshu happy "While I had my occasional doubts about you two, I'm glad that you found each other. So many near misses, close connections, heated moments..."
    urshu "Our sun goddess brought the warm light of friendship into Vivi's empty heart; our reporter helped the Avatar to realize there was more to her than a voice, more than a goddess." 
    urshu "Their verbal sparring matches were an intricate, passionate tango of emotional darts. Their time together burned down their outer defenses until only honesty and friendship remained." 
    urshu "It had always been there, though here, the All was the Two."

    # Epilogue/Friendship/Darius Wrecker

    # urshu happy "Darius Wrecker, former Inquisitor, soldier of the Lord of Eternal Rest, was a being who looked in the mirror and hated what they saw."
    # urshu happy "They regretted their past actions, but could not accept that they deserved anything but guilt and shame." 
    # urshu happy "With Vivi's help, they came to accept the possibility of a new journey: atonement." 
    # urshu happy "Forgiveness was a long way down the road. But for the first time, Darius thought, there could perhaps be a future for them at all."

    # urshu happy "Susu'Rha, desirous of a life of their own design, broke the chains of expectation and eschewed their royal title, opting instead for a life of anarchic expression in the Viridian Wood."
    # urshu happy "When the generational curse of war pulled them back, they found themself aboard the Ouroboros Express--and with you, Vivi."
    # urshu happy "Just as they helped you shatter the artifice that kept you from embodying your true essence, you helped them leave their past...in the past."
    # urshu happy "Now they can again sing songs and imbibe of endless joy in the world beyond the Terminal."
