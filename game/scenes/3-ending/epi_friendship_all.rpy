    # Epilogue/Friendship/Avatar of Asha
    # #Naj's note: this should just be a brief description - about 100 words, if that. Kind of like the slides at the end of Fallout, but it'll be from Urshu's perspective and they'll be against a plain, bright background. 

    # # LOCATION: terminalofdreams

    # urshu happy "While I had my occasional doubts about you two, I'm glad that you found each other. So many near misses, close connections, heated moments..."
    # urshu "Our sun goddess brought the warm light of friendship into Vivi's empty heart; our reporter helped the Avatar to realize there was more to her than a voice, more than a goddess." 
    # urshu "Their verbal sparring matches were an intricate, passionate tango of emotional darts. Their time together burned down their outer defenses until only honesty and friendship remained." 
    # urshu "It had always been there, though here, the All was the Two."
    # Epilogue/Friendship/Darius Wrecker
    # # LOCATION: terminalofdreams

    # urshu happy "Darius Wrecker, former Inquisitor, soldier of the Lord of Eternal Rest, was a being who looked in the mirror and hated what they saw."
    # urshu happy "They regretted their past actions, but could not accept that they deserved anything but guilt and shame." 
    # urshu happy "With Vivi's help, they came to accept the possibility of a new journey: atonement." 
    # urshu happy "Forgiveness was a long way down the road. But for the first time, Darius thought, there could perhaps be a future for them at all."

    # #Naj's note: this should just be a brief description - about 100 words, if that. Kind of like the slides at the end of Fallout, but it'll be from Urshu's perspective  and they'll be against a plain, bright background.

    # # LOCATION: terminalofdreams

    # urshu happy "Susu'Rha, desirous of a life of their own design, broke the chains of expectation and eschewed their royal title, opting instead for a life of anarchic expression in the Viridian Wood."
    # urshu happy "When the generational curse of war pulled them back, they found themself aboard the Ouroboros Express--and with you, Vivi."
    # urshu happy "Just as they helped you shatter the artifice that kept you from embodying your true essence, you helped them leave their past...in the past."
    # urshu happy "Now they can again sing songs and imbibe of endless joy in the world beyond the Terminal."
