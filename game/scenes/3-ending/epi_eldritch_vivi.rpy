    urshu sad "Anyone can change for the better, but they have to want to change."
    urshu "Unfortunately, Miss Sanssouci was stuck in her ways. She was too stubborn and too angry to open up. Her repressed self gave birth to emptiness. From the emptiness came the hunger, too strong for her decaying body. I should have realized sooner that she was meant for a different purpose." 
    urshu neutral "You can't have light without dark and you can't have absolution without punishment. Vivienne Sanssouci's body was altered to match her mind. A flowing dress and shards of a broken mirror flowing through eternity--an attractive facade concealing a devouring maw." 
    urshu "She finally got the life she pursued. She would no longer be censored and repressed by others."
    urshu happy "The new Vivi managed to make her way back to Earth...for a little revenge."
