    vivithinking surprised "Oh scat, someone’s coming. I could sense that roiling mind anywhere. Better make myself scarce, see if I can learn anything."

    darius angry "Leave me alone, princeling."

    susurha happy "Come on, show me."

    darius angry "I don’t know what you’re talking about. There is nothing to show."

    susurha happy "Are you telling me that as old and powerful as you are, you can’t show me a little sliver of something? A spark? A tendril."

    darius neutral blush "Who said I’m old and powerful? Go away."

    susurha happy "You won’t get rid of me that easily. I’ve got a sense for these things. Been around magic myself, you know."

    darius surprised "Hm. I’ll take your word for it."

    susurha happy "So...read my mind. Do it. What number am I thinking about? What shape is my tail making? How many claws am I holding up?"

    darius angry "Drop it."

    susurha neutral "Feh. You’re no fun. You probably couldn’t be of use anyway."

    darius neutral "So that’s it then. That’s why you’ve been hounding me through every damn car."

    susurha surprised "Well, I certainly didn’t do it for the company. You’d think the two of us would get along."

    darius surprised "Why would we...ever get along?"

    susurha happy "Because we have so much in common!"

    darius neutral "This is a joke. You’re mocking me. My time is better spent elsewhere."

    susurha neutral "No, wait. Wait. Seriously. I feel like between the two of us we can break out of here. Aren’t your kind supposed to be super powerful?"

    darius angry blush "I keep telling you no–"

    susurha happy "With your abilities and my magic affinity, I feel like we could slip away no problem! Or at least convince that sultry little conductor to cut us a deal."

    darius sad "I’ve cut enough deals. Once again: I decline. Leave my presence. Or I will leave yours."

    susurha sad "...I can feel you, you know. Through the walls. Across this whole train. It billows off of you, like ink dissipating through a glass of water."

    vivithinking "I’m not the only one who feels them?"

    darius neutral "Well. That’s just– it’s nothing. A psychic field, amplified by distress. Good day, little prince."

    vivi happy blush "Why the hell didn’t you say anything?"

    susurha happy blush "Wouldn’t want to make you uncomfortable. What do you say? Care to lounge with me?"

    vivi neutral "I– I’d better not. I should get back to the others. Another time."

    susurha happy "Suit yourself!"
